            <li>in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>

    <h3>Change of Purpose</h3>
    <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at <a href="mailto:adrian@wearegranzo.com">adrian@wearegranzo.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing.</p>
    <p>We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

    <h3 class="caps" style="text-align: center;">5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
    <p>
        We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:
        <ul>
            <li>Other companies in our group who provide IT and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.</li>
            <li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>

Specifically, with regulators we may share your data with the Phone-paid Services Authority and Ofcom as the regulators of phone-paid services in appropriate circumstances, including in the course of preliminary enquiries or formal investigations.</li>
            <li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

    <h3 class="caps" style="text-align: center;">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
    <p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
    <p>Occasionally we may utilise third parties service providers which are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
    <p>
        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure at least one the following safeguards is implemented:
        <ul>
            <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
            <li>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
    <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:adrian@wearegranzo.com">adrian@wearegranzo.com</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

    <h3 class="caps" style="text-align: center;">7. DATA SECURITY</h3>
    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <h3 class="caps" style="text-align: center;">8. DATA RETENTION</h3>
    <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
    <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

    <h3 class="caps" style="text-align: center;">9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
    <p>
        Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>

    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
